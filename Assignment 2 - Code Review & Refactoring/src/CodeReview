First of all, I created 2 necessary packages with specific name according to the purpose of the code:

ro.ase.csie.cts.bankaccount
ro.ase.csie.cts.bankaccount.exceptions 

One for the main class and interface, and the second one containing all custom exceptions used in the development

All variables are written using mixed camel case convention, having explicit names. (A problem in the previous code)
I minimized the accesibility of attributes, turning them private ( public in the initial code) 
I made public static fields final (to avoid caller changing the value)

According to the initial code, the account_Type(accountType) have 4 different types, so should be an enum.
I created the AccountType enum where with all the four types

According to the lead which requested the getMonthlyMethod a must implementation in all classes, I created the unique Interface
GetRateInterface which is implemented by the Account Class. 

The toString method is now implemented by overriding. (Initial toString was normally written).

The initial calculate method is now called calculateFee (I changed its name due to be more explici about the use of it)
In this method are used 2 values (365 and .0125) so for them I created 2 static variables (totalNrDays, brokersFee)
Here, I put the condition (accounts != null) because if the array was empty there will be no meaning for the method
Also, the method didn't used indentation

I used 3 custom Exceptions:
InvalidActiveDaysException -> if the number of days is lower than 1 and grater than 365(nr of days in an year)
InvalidLoadValueException -> if the loan value is smaller or equal than 0
InvalidRateException -> if the rate is not in the 0, 1 Interval
I used them in the constructor where I initialized the attributes. In the initial code, not all the attributes were initialized.  

For the loanValue I decided to be <=0 because I in my point of view We can't get a loan of 0 money. 
I deleted the double load() method the getter of rate (getRate()) and the print() method because I don't see them necessary in the code. 
They were just returning their values and the print() one return a simple text. 
They don't have any impact for the code itself or for the ones who are using it.
